# Benchmark Suite: Contrek vs OpenCV

## 1. Project Description
This project was developed to evaluate and compare the performance of **Contrek** against **OpenCV** in the field of contour extraction. The entire system is containerized via Docker and offers two testing modalities:

* **High-Level:** A comparison between the Contrek Ruby extension and OpenCV Python bindings using identical image sets.
* **Low-Level (Native):** A direct C++ comparison to measure the raw efficiency of both processing engines.

Configurations have been calibrated to ensure visually identical results: both engines extract external contours and holes with equivalent topological precision. Users can enable a visual validation flag to generate PNG images of the processed polygons, highlighting external boundaries in red and internal holes in green.

## 2. Philosophy and Objectives

While OpenCV is the industry standard for single-threaded efficiency, Contrek explores a different architectural territory where multi-core parallelism is the priority:

* **A) Single-Image Latency:** While OpenCV excels in *throughput* (processing multiple images simultaneously across different processes), Contrek focuses on minimizing the processing time of a **single ultra-high-resolution image**. By utilizing all available CPU cores through a *Stripe-Merging* algorithm, it significantly reduces end-user latency for gigapixel-scale workloads.
* **B) Memory Efficiency:** Moving away from a strictly monolithic loading approach, Contrek adopts a "streaming-oriented" philosophy. This allows the engine to process extreme-resolution images with a significantly lower and more stable RAM footprint compared to standard methods, making high-end analysis feasible on standard hardware where OpenCV might hit memory limits.

Contrek is not intended as a general-purpose replacement for OpenCV, but rather as a specialized high-performance tool for scenarios where single-image speed and memory scalability are the primary constraints.

### Build and Launch
```bash
# Build the image using Docker Compose
sudo docker compose build test

# Run the container
sudo docker compose run test
```

### Internal Configuration
Once inside the container shell, run the setup script to install Ruby dependencies:

```bash
./build.sh
```
To ensure you are aligned with the latest core updates, it is recommended to run gem update contrek).
```bash
gem update contrek
```

### Executing High-Level Tests (Ruby vs Python)
Navigate to the test directory and run the benchmarks:

```Bash
cd test
ruby test_contrek.rb
python3 test_opencv.py
```
Results will be aggregated into a **test/report.html** file.

### Visual Validation:
To verify the precision of the results graphically, add the --draw flag:

```Bash
ruby test_contrek.rb --draw
python3 test_opencv.py --draw
```
The resulting images will be saved in the **test/output** directory. This process may take several minutes on the ruby side.

### Executing Low-Level Tests (Native C++)
For a direct comparison between the C++ cores:

```Bash
cd test
./cpp_test.sh
```
This script downloads the source code, compiles it via CMake, and launches the benchmarks. For subsequent runs:

```Bash
cd build
./contrek_opencv_benchmark
```
Note: It is recommended to run the tests multiple times; initial runs may be slower due to library memory allocation and caching.

### 4. Benchmark Results
The following data was obtained in a virtualized environment (VMware Virtual Machine) featuring an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor (BogoMIPS: 7199.99) on an Ubuntu distribution.

| **test_10240x10240** | 10240x10240 | 0.566 s | **0.468 s** | 219 / 2259 |
| **test_10000x10000** | 10000x10000 | 0.706 s | 0.794 s | 806 / 371 |
| **test_4096x4096** | 4096x4096 | 1.292 s | **0.998 s** | 625 / 128689 |
| **test_1024x1024** | 1024x1024 | 0.023 s | 0.049 s | 219 / 2259 |

**Performance Notes:**
* In high-density **4k** and **10k** tests, the Contrek Ruby extension outperforms OpenCV's Python bindings despite language overhead, thanks to parallel thread management (8 threads / 8 tiles).
* Results confirm that the precision of the extracted polygons is nearly identical between the two systems.
